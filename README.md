# Evaluate-a-News-Article-with_NLP

Udacity Evaluate a News Article with Naturla Language Processing

Project Description: The project consists in developing a web application that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. Using the Sentiment Analysis api from Aylien (https://docs.aylien.com/textapi/endpoints/#sentiment-analysis), it will give back pertinent information about the article, like whether the content is subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in tone.


Objective: Implement the application using the acquired knowledge of Webpack configuration for developing in a development and production environments. Also, use different loaders and plugins to enhance productivity and the advantages of Webpack.

## Installation

    - npm install: for installing all devDependencies and dependencies of the package.json


## Package scripts for Webpack Configurations:

Node and express will be the webserver and routing of choice, and webpack will be the build tool of choice. Using webpack, you have the option of building both development and production environments, each with their own set of tools and commands with package.json scripts.

    - npm run build-dev: for building the application in developer mode()
    - npm run build-prod: for building the application in production mode().
    - npm run start: for running application in production mode on server using port 8081.
    - npm jest-test: for running jest tests
    - CTRL + C: To stop
